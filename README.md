# MoreEfficientUseOfEnergyInResidentialAreas

Project developed at Utrecht University during the Energy Science master thesis course in Advanced Energy Analysis. 
It is an indepth analysis on more efficient electricity and heat supply in residential areas. Four different scenarios are taken into account (central CHP, fractionated fuel cell, fractionated heat pump and fractionated boiler).
The analysis is composed by the assessment per each scenario of CO2 emissions, sensitivity analyses with variation of different parameters, costs (both CAPEX and OPEX) with different plant sizes, energy consumption, Multi Criteria Analysis and a final part regarding reccomandations towards a possible client.
